# Property Tax XML Project (Mock)

This project simulates a simplified property tax reporting system used by Michigan counties to submit data to the State Treasury Department.

## 📂 Files Included

- **property_tax_schema.xsd**  
  Defines the required structure and data types for a county tax report. Uses XSD to enforce formatting, required fields, and valid data types such as `string`, `decimal`, `date`, and `boolean`.

- **property_tax_report.xml**  
  A sample submission from Ingham County including two property tax records. This file conforms to the schema and was validated using Oxygen XML Editor.

## ✅ Features

- Built using real-world standards used by government systems
- Fully schema-compliant XML document
- Developed and validated in **Oxygen XML Editor** (used by State of Michigan)
- Includes validation logic for multiple property entries, correct field types, and required values

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
- XSD (XML Schema Definition)
- Oxygen XML Editor
- GitHub

## 🧠 Purpose

This mock project was built to demonstrate practical experience with XML and schema validation. It's modeled after the kind of data exchange processes used in government data systems (e.g., Michigan Treasury property reporting).

## 📈 Use Case

Can be expanded into more complex systems for:
- Government data intake
- Tax systems
- GIS and parcel management
- XML-based document processing
